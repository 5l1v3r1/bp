BluePrint v0.1 
(c) Collin Mulliner and Martin Herfurt - the trifinite group

BluePrint is Bluetooth fingerprinting tool, which works much like nmap (tcp/ip)

more information at: http://www.trifinite.org/trifinite_stuff_blueprinting.html

usage:
 
 just run "bd.pl" in will print out the usage information
 
 bp.pl reads the output from "sdptool browse" and generates the finger print
 for it

adding fingerprints:

 Add file containing the output of sdptool browse BD_ADDR and information about
 the scanned device to the devices directory. The first line of the file
 must contain the BD_ADDR (MAC) of the device. The device information must
 be enclosed in "---info" and "/---info" tags. The sdp data must be
 enclosed in "---sdp" and "/---sdp". Check the existing files to see
 how it is done.
 After adding new files just run: mkdb.pl

adding more information:
 
 port scan the device (bt_audit is available at www.trifinite.org)
  btaudit.sh <BD_ADDR>
	 or
  psm_scan -o -s 1 -e 65535 <BD_ADDR>
	rfcomm_scan -o <BD_ADDR>

 get hardware info
  hcitool info <BD_ADDR>

 get device info from mobile phones using obexftp
  obexftp -b <BD_ADDR> -B <CHANNEL> -g telecom/devinfo.txt

 get capabilities from obex server (btobex is available at www.bluez.org)
  btobex getcap <BD_ADDR> <CHANNEL>
